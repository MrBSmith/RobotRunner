DIAL_LEVEL1A_1;Pouet;Here you are, my sublime creations! I really would like to introduce you to this brand new world you don't know yet, but, well… This facility is about to blow up! A turbine of Xion -the gaz fueling the factory- broke up, so a massive cloud of Xion is about to destroy everything here. I just had time to wake you, so you will have to learn everything on the fly. First tip: stay as far as you can from the cloud. Second tip: RUN!
DIAL_LEVEL1A_2;;You see that blue flame that you've just lit ?! That's how my little time machine works. It can gets you back to the last blue flame you've met. Make sure not to miss the next ones!
DIAL_LEVEL1A_3;;You can get some Xion energy form these crates. It might be useful, who knows…
DIAL_LEVEL1A_4;;The exit is near! All you need to do is to trigger the buttons and the door will open. But you won't be safer in the next area: continue running fast or the Xion will fry your precious circuits.
