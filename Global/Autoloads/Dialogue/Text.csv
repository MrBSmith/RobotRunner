DIAL_LEVEL1A_1;Pouet;Here you are, my sublime creations! I really would like to introduce you to this brand new world you don't know yet, but, well… This facility is about to blow up! A turbine of Xion -the gaz fueling the factory- broke up, so a massive cloud of Xion is about to destroy everything here. I just had time to wake you, so you will have to learn everything on the fly. But don't worry too much for now, I have restrainted the gaz leak to the engine room. This room is safe. 
DIAL_LEVEL1A_2;;I've prepared some of my minions to show you the way. They will learn you everything you need to know, more or less. They are dumb as hell, but well it will have to do.
DIAL_LEVEL1A_3;;Well, nervemind what I said before: This room is NOT safe. Now stay as far as you can from the Xion cloud and RUN!
DIAL_LEVEL1A_4;;Do you see these purple crates? DON'T TOUCH IT! This is where I stock my precious Xion energy.
DIAL_LEVEL1A_5;;You see that blue flame that you've just lit ?! That's how my little time machine works. It can gets you back to the last blue flame you've met. Make sure not to miss the next ones!
DIAL_LEVEL1A_6;;The exit is near! All you need to do is to trigger the buttons and the door will open. But you won't be safer in the next area: continue running fast or the Xion will fry your precious circuits.
